Configurations Service
The configuration service is how users create and tune configurations, and tune Natural Language Processing (NLP) features.
When creating or updating a configuration or an NLP feature, the information should be stored in a file as a JSON, and the full path to the file passed as the --data option.
For more information about, see api-20.semantria.com/configs/swagger-ui.html#/
