Docs Service:
The documents service is for sending documents to be analyzed by Semantria and retreiving the results.
There are two ways documents can be uploaded to Semantria, both use the --data option. The first is to give the file path name preceded with the @ symbol.
The second is to pass a single  document as a string.
